# Let's Build a SlackApp on AWS 
Build on Weekly show on Twitch.tv/aws - episode 11

## Description

Building a [slack app](https://slack.com/apps) that shares Tech News articles when published to slack. This is a webhook app. We will use [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) and [Amazon CloudWatch Events](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to build out the functionality. We will use tech news feeds from [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/hub)
